# BruteForce-Simulator

This project simulates a basic brute-force attack against a dummy login system using a sample of the popular `rockyou_sample.txt` password list.


1. `login_system.py`: contains a simple username/password checker.
2. `brute_force.py`: attempts to guess the correct password using a wordlist.
3. `rockyou_sample.txt`: a small list of common passwords.
